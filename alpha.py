This Simple tool will start my tmux session lnotes.
The session will start up my docker containers that 
run my notes app as well as the various tmux windows
and panes that I like. I like to have two windows
where the second window is split into two panes.

The tool will have two options. The first one will
start the session and the second option will end it.
The end sequence will always include a git commit.
